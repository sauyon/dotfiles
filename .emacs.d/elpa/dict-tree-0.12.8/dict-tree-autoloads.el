(autoload 'make-dictree "dict-tree" "\
Create an empty dictionary and return it.

If NAME is supplied, the dictionary is stored in the variable
NAME. Defaults to FILENAME stripped of directory and
extension. (Regardless of the value of NAME, the dictionary will
be stored in the default variable name when it is reloaded from
file.)

FILENAME supplies a directory and file name to use when saving
the dictionary. If the AUTOSAVE flag is non-nil, then the
dictionary will automatically be saved to this file when it is
unloaded or when exiting Emacs.

If UNLISTED is non-nil, the dictionary will not be added to the
list of loaded dictionaries. Note that this disables autosaving.

COMPARE-FUNCTION sets the function used to compare elements of
the keys. It should take two arguments, A and B, both of the type
contained by the sequences used as keys (e.g. if the keys will
be strings, the function will be passed two characters). It
should return t if the first is \"less than\" the
second. Defaults to `<'.

INSERT-FUNCTION sets the function used to insert data into the
dictionary. It should take two arguments: the new data, and the
data already in the dictionary, and should return the data to
insert. Defaults to replacing any existing data with the new
data.

RANK-FUNCTION sets the function used to rank the results of
`dictree-complete'. It should take two arguments, each a cons
whose car is a dictree key (a sequence) and whose cdr is the data
associated with that key. It should return non-nil if the first
argument is \"better\" than the second, nil otherwise. It
defaults to \"lexical\" comparison of the keys, ignoring the data
\(which is not very useful, since an unranked `dictree-complete'
query already does this much more efficiently).

CACHE-POLICY should be a symbol ('time, 'length, or 'both), which
determines which query operations are cached. The 'time setting
caches queries that take longer (in seconds) than the
corresponding CACHE-THRESHOLD value. The 'length setting caches
lookups of key sequences that are longer than
LOOKUP-CACHE-THRESHOLD value (since those are likely to be the
slower ones), and caches completions of prefixes that are shorter
than the corresponding CACHE-THRESHOLD (since those are likely to
be the slower ones in that case). The setting 'both requires both
conditions to be satisfied simultaneously. In this case,
CACHE-THRESHOLD must be a plist with properties :time and :length
specifying the corresponding cache thresholds.

CACHE-UPDATE-POLICY should be a symbol ('synchronize or 'delete),
which determines how the caches are updated when data is inserted
or deleted. The former updates tainted cache entries, which makes
queries faster but insertion and deletion slower, whereas the
latter deletes any tainted cache entries, which makes queries
slower but insertion and deletion faster.

The CACHE-THRESHOLD settings set the threshold for caching the
corresponding dictionary query (lookup, completion, ranked
completion). The meaning of these values depends on the setting
of CACHE-POLICY (see above).

All CACHE-THRESHOLD's default to nil. The values nil and t are
special. If a CACHE-THRESHOLD is set to nil, no caching is done
for that type of query. If it is t, everything is cached for that
type of query (similar behaviour can be obtained by setting the
CACHE-THRESHOLD to 0, but it is better to use t).

KEY-SAVEFUN, DATA-SAVEFUN and PLIST-SAVEFUN are functions used to
convert keys, data and property lists into lisp objects that have
a valid read syntax, for writing to file. DATA-SAVEFUN and
PLIST-SAVEFUN are used when saving the dictionary (see
`dictree-save' and `dictree-write'), and all three functions are
used when dumping the contents of the dictionary (see
`dictree-dump-to-buffer' and `dictree-dump-to-file').
KEY-SAVEFUN, DATA-SAVEFUN and PLIST-SAVEFUN should each accept
one argument: a key, data or property list from DICT,
respectively. They should return a lisp object which has a valid
read syntax. When defining these functions, be careful not to
accidentally modify the lisp object in the dictionary; usually,
you will need to make a copy before converting it.

KEY-LOADFUN, DATA-LOADFUN and PLIST-LOADFUN are used to convert
keys, data and property lists back again when loading a
dictionary (only DATA-LOADFUN and PLIST-LOADFUN, see
`dictree-save' and `dictree-write') or populating it from a
file (all three, see `dictree-populate-from-file'). They should
accept one argument: a lisp object of the type produced by the
corresponding SAVEFUN, and return a lisp object to use in the
loaded dictionary.

TRIE-TYPE sets the type of trie to use as the underlying data
structure. See `trie-create' for details.

(autoload 'make-dictree-meta-dict "dict-tree" "\
Create a meta-dictionary based on the list of dictionaries

COMBINE-FUNCTION is used to combine data from different
dictionaries. It is passed two pieces of data, each an
association of the same key, but in different dictionaries. It
should return a combined datum.

The other arguments are as for `dictree-create'. Note that
caching is only possible if NAME is supplied, otherwise the
cache-threshold arguments are ignored.

(autoload 'read-dict "dict-tree" "\
Read the name of a dictionary with completion, and return it.

Prompt with PROMPT. By default, return DEFAULT. If DICTLIST is

If ALLOW-UNLOADED is non-nil, also complete on the names of
unloaded dictionaries (actually, on any Elisp file in the current
`load-path' restricted to subdirectories of your home directory
whose file name starts with \"dict-\"). If an unloaded dictionary
is read, the name of the Elisp file will be returned, without
extension, suitable for passing to `load-library'.
