(defalias 'make-trie 'trie--create "\
Return a new trie that uses comparison function COMPARISON-FUNCTION.

A trie stores sequences (strings, vectors or lists) along with
associated data. COMPARISON-FUNCTEION should accept two
arguments, each being an element of such a sequence, and return t
if the first is strictly smaller than the second.

The optional argument TYPE specifies the type of trie to
create. However, the only one that is currently implemented is
the default, so this argument is useless for now.

\(See also `make-trie-custom'.)")

(defalias 'make-trie-custom 'trie--create-custom "\
Return a new trie that uses comparison function COMPARISON-FUNCTION.

A trie stores sequences (strings, vectors or lists) along with
associated data. COMPARISON-FUNCTION should accept two arguments,
each being an element of such a sequence, and return t if the
first is strictly smaller than the second.

The remaining keyword arguments: :CREATEFUN, :INSERTFUN, :DELETEFUN,
:LOOKUPFUN, :MAPFUN, :EMPTYFUN, :STACK-CREATEFUN, :STACK-POPFUN,
:STACK-EMPTYFUN, :TRANSFORM-FOR-PRINT and :TRANSFORM-FROM-READ
determine the type of trie that is created.

CREATEFUN is called as follows:

  (CREATEFUN COMPARISON-FUNCTION SEQ)

and should return a data structure (\"ARRAY\") that can be used
as an associative array, where two elements A and B are equal if
the following is non-nil:

  (and (COMPARISON-FUNCTION b a)
       (COMPARISON-FUNCTION b a))

The SEQ argument is a vector containing the sequence that will
correspond to the newly created array in the trie. For most types
of trie, this value is ignored. It is passed to CREATEFUN only in
order to allow the creation of \"hybrid\" trie structures, in
which different types of associative array are used in different
parts of the trie. For example, the type of associative array
could be chosen based on the depth in the trie, given by (length
SEQ). (Note that all the other functions described below must be
able to correctly handle *any* of the types of associate array
that might be created by CREATEFUN.)

INSERTFUN, DELETEFUN, LOOKUPFUN, MAPFUN and EMPTYFUN should
insert, delete, lookup, map over, and check-if-there-exist-any
elements in an associative array. They are called as follows:

  (INSERTFUN array element &optional updatefun)
  (DELETEFUN array element &optional predicate nilflag)
  (LOOKUPFUN array element &optional nilflag)
  (MAPFUN function array &optional reverse)
  (EMPTYFUN array)

INSERTFUN should insert ELEMENT into ARRAY and return the new
element, which will be ELEMENT itself unless UPDATEFUN is
specified. In that case, if and only if an element matching
ELEMENT already exists in the associative array, INSERTFUN should
instead pass ELEMENT and the matching element as arguments to
UPDATEFUN, replace the matching element with the return value,
and return that return value.

DELETEFUN should delete the element in the associative array that
matches ELEMENT, and return the deleted element. However, if
PREDICATE is specified and a matching element exists in ARRAY,
DELETEFUN should first pass the matching element as an argument
to PREDICATE before deleting, and should only delete the element
if PREDICATE returns non-nil. DELETEFUN should return NILFLAG if
no element was deleted (either becuase no matching element was
found, or because TESTFUN returned nil).

LOOKUPFUN should return the element from the associative array
that matches ELEMENT, or NILFLAG if no matching element exists.

MAPFUN should map FUNCTION over all elements in the order defined by
COMPARISON-FUNCTION, or in reverse order if REVERSE is non-nil.


STACK-CREATEFUN, STACK-POPFUN and STACK-EMPTYFUN should allow the
associative array to be used as a stack. STACK-CREATEFUN is
called as follows:

  (STACK-CREATEFUN array)

and should return a data structure (\"STACK\") that behaves like
a sorted stack of all elements in the associative array. I.e.
successive calls to

  (STACK-POPFUN stack)

should return elements from the associative array in the order
defined by COMPARISON-FUNCTION, and

  (STACK-EMPTYFUN stack)

should return non-nil if the stack is empty, nil otherwise.

The stack functions are optional, in that all trie operations
other than the stack-related ones will work correctly. However,
any code that makes use of trie-stacks will complain if supplied
with this type of trie.


The :TRANSFORM-FOR-PRINT and :TRANSFORM-FROM-READ arguments are
optional. If supplied, they can be used to transform the trie
into a format suitable for passing to Elisp's `print'
functions (typically used to persistently store the trie by
writing it to file), and transform from that format back to the
original usable form.


Warning: to avoid nasty dynamic scoping bugs, the supplied
functions must *never* bind any variables with names commencing
\"--\".")
